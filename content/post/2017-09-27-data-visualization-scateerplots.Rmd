##Basics of Visualization
```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```

###Extracting Data
First, let's have R take the data and store it in a variable it will remember.
```{r}
query<-"Select playerID, sum(HR) AS Career_HR, sum(SO) AS Career_SO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(hr)>=400"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

###Visualizing Data

Now it's time to actually display the data in a  recognizable format.
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=Career_SO,y=Career_HR), size=3)+
ggtitle("Career Strikeout VS Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
xlab("Career Strikeouts")+ ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
